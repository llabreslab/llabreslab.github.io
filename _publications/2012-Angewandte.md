title: "Exploration of Forbidden Povarov Processes as a Source of Unexpected Reactivity: A Multicomponent Mannich–Ritter Transformation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2012-Angewandte
excerpt: 'The use of geometrically or electronically restricted imines for Povarov‐type processes does not afford the anti‐Bredt tetrahydroquinolines, but leads instead to highly functionalized structures through novel reaction pathways (see picture; LA=Lewis acid). The exploration of “forbidden” routes constitutes a valuable approach in the search for new multicomponent reactions.'
