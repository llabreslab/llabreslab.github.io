  * EPCC, University of Edinburgh (UK)
  * Part of the EPCC working team of BioExcel-2 project:
    - Provided user support to CP2K users to perform QM/MM simulations of biomolecular systems. 
    - Co-developed several tools, documentation and tutorials for QM/MM simulations in CP2K. 
  * Part of ARCHER Helpdesk support team. 

* **Jan 2018 - Dec 2018:** PostDoctoral Research Assistant

* **Jan 2016 - Dec 2017:** PostDoctoral Research Assistant
  * School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee (UK)
  * **Supervisor:** Dr Ulrich Zachariae
  * Antimicrobial resistance of Gram-negative bacteria projects:
    - Proposed a novel mechanism by which a newly discovered family of efflux pumps confers antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. 
    - Studied the effect of mutations of porins that alter the permeability of antibiotic molecules.

* **Nov 2013 - Apr 2014:** Visiting PhD student
  * Faculty of Pharmacy, Alma Mater Studiorum -Universit√† de Bologna (Italy)
  * **Supervisor:** Prof Andrea Cavalli
  * Elucidated the binding mechanism of inhibitor binding to the M2 channel via enhanced sampling techniques.

* **Jun 2011 - Jul 2015:** PhD and MSc
  * Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitat de Barcelona (Spain)
  * **Supervisor:** Profs Francisco Javier Luque and Ramon Pouplana
  * Applied rational design techniques to drive hit-to-lead development of inhibitors against M2 protein of drug-resistant variants of Influenza virus.
