I'm a Juan de la Cierva Researcher at the Department of Nutrition, Food sciences and Gastronomy of the University of Barcelona.

I'm a computational chemist working on the study of biomolecular systems and computer aided drug design projects. My expertise focuses on the use of molecular modelling methods to model challenging biological systems including large membrane proteins and the use of molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced sampling techniques to characterise protein dynamics and to obtain energy profiles of biological processes.


Short Bio
======

I obtained my PhD on Biotechnology at the University of Barcelona in 2015, which focused on the development of novel anti-Influenza inhibitors via mechanistic studies and drug design approaches. After my PhD, I moved to the group of Dr Ulrich Zachariae at the University of Dundee as a postdoctoral research assistant to investigate the mechanisms of resistance of Gram-negative bacteria. In 2018, I joined the group of Dr. Julien Michel at the University of Edinburgh to study the conformational fluctuations and energetic landscapes of intrinsic disordered regions of proteins. In 2019, she started working at the EPCC at the University of Edinburgh as an Applications developer in Data Science, where she was actively involved in the BioExcel-2 project. In September of 2020, I joined the Computational Biology and Drug Design group (CBDD) as a Juan de la Cierva researcher. 


My work and research
======
...

Here I list some of my current research interests:

Active transport across membranes
-------
The active transport of biomolecules through biological membranes require specialised membrane proteins able to translocate substrates selectively and in most cases agaisnt gradient. Mutations on these proteins are often related to pathological phentoypes. 

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)
-------
The current rise in antimicrobial resistance urges the development of new antibiotic drugs. Gram-negative constitute the vast majority of priority pathogens exhibiting multi- or pan-drug resistance. 

Protein Tandem repeats
-------
Protein repeats account for over the 10% of the human proteome. Each repeat has a defined length and fold and the cell uses it for  diverse purposes such as a structural role (collagen) or nuclear transport (importins).
