The **Membrane Protein Modelling** group led by Dr. Salomé Llabrés is dedicated to the development and the application of methods to study membrane proteins of biomedical interest. Our primary interest lies in understanding the processes that enable the functions of large membrane protein complexes systems involved in the **active transport across membranes**. Our group leverages the use of computational chemistry, biophysics and molecular biology to investigate these challenging systems. We currently have two main research lines on the study key membrane proteins causing genetic metabolic diseases and antimicrobial resistance. 

**Genetic metabolic diseases that impair cholesterol absorption**

The active transport of biomolecules through biological membranes require specialised membrane proteins able to translocate substrates selectively and in most cases against concentration gradient. Mutations on these proteins are often related to pathological phentoypes.

**Mechanisms of Antimicrobial Resistance**

The current rise in antimicrobial resistance urges the development of new antibiotic drugs. Gram-negative constitute the vast majority of priority pathogens exhibiting multi- or pan-drug resistance.
