The **Membrane Protein Modelling** group led by Dr. Salomé Llabrés is dedicated to the development and the application of methods to study membrane proteins of biomedical interest. Our primary interest lies in understanding the processes that enable the functions of large membrane protein complexes systems involved in the **active transport across membranes**. Our group leverages the use of computational chemistry, biophysics and molecular biology to investigate these challenging systems. We currently have two main research lines on the study key membrane proteins causing genetic metabolic diseases and antimicrobial resistance.
