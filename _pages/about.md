I'm a Juan de la Cierva Researcher at the Department of Nutrition, Food sciences and Gastronomy of the University of Barcelona.

I'm a computational chemist with 9 years of experience working on the study of biomolecular systems and computer aided drug design projects. My expertise focuses on the use of molecular modelling methods to model challenging biological systems including large membrane proteins and the use of molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced sampling techniques to characterise protein dynamics and to obtain energy profiles of biological processes. I thrive working as part of multidisciplinary teams, including experimental collaborators and research software engineers, in order to reach a common goal. 


My work and research

Here I list some of my current research interests:

Active transport across membranes
-------
The active transport of biomolecules through biological membranes require specialised membrane proteins able to translocate substrates selectively and in most cases agaisnt gradient. Mutations on these proteins are often related to pathological phentoypes. 

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)
-------
The current rise in antimicrobial resistance urges the development of new antibiotic drugs. Gram-negative constitute the vast majority of priority pathogens exhibiting multi- or pan-drug resistance. 

Protein Tandem repeats
-------
Protein repeats account for over the 10% of the human proteome. Each repeat has a defined length and fold and the cell uses it for  diverse purposes such as a structural role (collagen) or nuclear transport (importins).
