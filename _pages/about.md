The **Membrane Protein Modelling** group led by Dr. Salomé Llabrés is dedicated to the development and the application of methods to study membrane proteins of biomedical interest. Our primary interest lies in understanding the processes that enable the functions of large membrane protein complexes systems involved in the **active transport across membranes**. Our group leverages the use of computational chemistry, biophysics and molecular biology to investigate these challenging systems. We currently have two main research lines on the study key membrane proteins causing genetic metabolic diseases and antimicrobial resistance.

## Research interests
-----------------

**Genetic metabolic diseases impairing cholesterol absorption**

Cholesterol homeostasis is vital for proper cellular and systemic functions. Disturbed cholesterol balance underlies not only cardiovascular disease but also an increasing number of other diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. We focus on the study of NPC1 and NPC1L1 importers that play crucial roles in cholesterol homoestasis and when mutated give rise to importar metabolic syndromes like Niemann-Pick Disease.

**Mechanisms of Antimicrobial Resistance**

Antimicrobial resistance is an unfolding global health crisis for that the scientific community has failed to answer effectively. The WHO anticipates that the antibiotic candidates in the pipeline will not suffice to face the increasing number of drug resistant bacterial strains, especially of Gram-negative pathogens. In order to understand the appearance of multi-drug resistant strain, we must understand their mechanisms of resistance. We focus on the study of membrane protein complexes involved that confer resistance to antibiotic treatments, such as the mutation of porin pores and expression of efflux pumps.
