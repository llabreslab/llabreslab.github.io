Carolina Estarellas and me had two sessions in the Summer school of [Advanced Molecular Modelling: Biomolecules and Drug Design](https://www.iqtc.ub.edu/education-outreach/advanced-molecular-modelling-2/) organised by the IQTC. We taught the principles behind  molecular dynamics and gave the hands-on tutorial on how to set up a biological system using Ambertools. 

You can find the tutorial [here](https://salomellabres.github.io/2021_07_08_iqtcub_md/).
