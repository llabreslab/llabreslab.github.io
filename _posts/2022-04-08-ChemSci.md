My postdoctoral work on the selectivity of a drug-like small molecules on the oncoprotein MDM2 is finally out in Chemical Science. We explored the molecular determinants that guide the binding of Nutlin-3a and AMG-7209 to MDM2, which involves the disorder-to-order transition of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal region of MDM2. Moreover, we developed a protocol able to accurately estimate the binding affinities of these ligands using complete thermodynamic analysis that featured adaptive absolute alchemical free energy of binding calculations with enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations.
