My postdoctoral work on the selectivity of a drug-like small molecules on the oncoprotein MDM2 is finally out in Chemical Science. While I was a PDRA at the group of Dr Julien Michel at the University of Edinburgh, we explored the molecular determinants that guide the binding of Nutlin-3a and AMG-7209 to MDM2, which involves the disorder-to-order transition of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal region of MDM2. Moreover, we developed a protocol able to accurately estimate the binding affinities of these ligands using complete thermodynamic analysis that featured adaptive absolute alchemical free energy of binding calculations with enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations. 

I am very proud of this work as it brought together a multidisciplinary team (Cesar, Arun, Michalis and I) from the Michel group to tackle this challenging target. I really enjoyed it!
