A Best Practice Guide for Biomolecular QM/MM simulations with CP2K for beginners
===

As part of my work in the BioExcel-2 project at the EPCC, I co-wrote a best practice guide on how to perform QM/MM simulations of biomolecules using CP2K. We provided an overview of the main steps in setting up and running a QM/MM simulation in CP2K. We cover steps starting from preparing your system to running a production QM/MM run. This BPG is designed to be read from the point of view of beginner users. 

Here is the link:

**Authors:** [Dr Holly Judge](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/about/staff/holly-judge), **Dr Salome Llabres** and [Dr Arno Proeme](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/about/staff/dr-arno-proeme)

Also, I developed a set of python3 tools to deal with the set up of CP2K simulations. I hope you find them useful!
