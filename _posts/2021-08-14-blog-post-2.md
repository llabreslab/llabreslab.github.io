I have been granted access to PRACE resources for this coming year! 

We will use the brand new [Snellius supercomputer](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/snellius) to shed light on the molecular mechanism of a efflux pump of *E. coli* using molecular dynamics simulations. Unravelling the mechanism that underpins its function will help us understand **how this complex machinery works** and **how to inhibit it with small molecules**. Efflux Pump Inhibitors have the potential to restore the effectivity of antibiotic treatments on bacterial strains that have become resistant, and therefore help tackle the unfolding antimicrobial resistance crisis.
