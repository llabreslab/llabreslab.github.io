Many proteins recognise other proteins via mechanisms that involve the folding of intrinsically disordered regions upon complex formation. Such is the case of the binding of the compound AM-7209, which has been reported to confer order upon an intrinsically disordered ‘lid’ region of the oncoprotein MDM2 in opposition to the binding of the ligand Nutlin-3a. 
We investigated the energetics of this ordering process via ITC calorimetry, adaptive absolute alchemical free energy of binding calculations and enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations.

I made this picture to be used as a graphical abstract for the publication and for dissemination of the work. I used Blender and VMD.
